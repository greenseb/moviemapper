# Movie Mapper

![Movie Mapper Preview](https://i.ibb.co/306bJVS/mapper.png)

This web app offers an interactive map where you can view and drop pins. The pins represent famous movie locations and give information such as:

* Location
* Description
* Rating
* Author
* Timestamp

You can register as a new user and log in to drop new pins, which you can do by double clicking anywhere on the map. You will be able to tell your pins apart from other users by colour.
